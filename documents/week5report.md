# week 5 report
Time spent on project 10 hours.

## How did the project advance?

I added melee animation and character sprint. Now the generated map can be rendered and added code which generates paths between rooms. I also slightly improved the algo for map generation.

## Problems

Adding collisions turned out to be a bigger hurdle than thought thus i didn't add them this week.

## Next week

Add collision, improve map generation so it is more random and add test for map generation.
