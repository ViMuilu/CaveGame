# week 2 report
Time spent on project 8 hours.

## What i did

I mostly tried to find a good game development library. And after finding a suitable one i spent some time figuring out the basics of it. I also tried to find suitable assets for the game  which i also had to edit a bit.
More info on the libgdx library can be found on the design document

## How did the project advance?

I managed to create a movable character.

## Problems

Since libGDX generates the program file and also the gradle.build file i didn't manage to set up jacoco yet.

## Next week

I will try to smooth out the character movement and also add character animations + maybe try to set up object collision.
