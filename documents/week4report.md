# week 4 report
Time spent on project 6 hours.
Due to unforseen sircumstances i could not work during friday like i usually do therefore the project did not advance as much as i would have liked it to.

## What i did

Spent time studying the bsp map generation and also started to work on it.

## How did the project advance?

The program can now generate a map array and post it to the IDE output.

## Problems

The code which generates the map(Node.divide) might not be complex eneugh for the course. I would appriciate a comment on this. The code only needs some fine tuning and i think i can try and make it a bit more complex by making it create a binary tree out of the nodes. But even then placing objects and opponents by sorting through the map array might be as fast.

## Next week

Finish map generation, add collision, attack animation and tests for the map generation.
