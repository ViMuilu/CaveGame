# week 6 report
Time spent on project 9 hours.

## How did the project advance?

Added junit plugin. Alos adde wall hitboxes.

## Problems

I wasted a lot of time figuring out how to make libgdx and junit work together and thus i didn't have time to add unit tests. Also wall hitboxes need some finetuning.

## Next week
Finish Bsp algo, add tests, finish wall hitboxes and start working on cellular automata algo.
